## Section 1: General Info

The project has a two-dimensional array to be used as a table for the sales of each store and each item as well as calculating the total by row and column. The following stores with the highest sales or lowest sales will be highlighted by color.

## Section 3: Behind the Scenes

I’ve been getting the hang of “.html” files because they’re like instructions, read the description and make the project work like expected. Although, one of the methods for each “.html” file were quite unnecessary to add at least to me because we weren’t really using them in the other files for the project. Before I went to testing, I thought we would create our own test table, but we have to use the district files from the Notepad. 
When I read the “.html” instructions, I didn’t know what to do with the methods that have no description, so I left them blank (unless if it’s something we have to do). When I worked on the “TwoDimRaggedArray” java file, working on the steps can get a bit annoying like trying to solve puzzles; for the row methods, I copied and pasted my work from the column methods with some edits to get through the steps a bit easier and quicker. If that applies with Assignment 6, I’ll keep working the strategy.
I can succeed with memorizing the JavaFX set up just like the previous Assignments because JavaFX files have been a requirement since Assignment 3. I enjoyed coming up with function names and return results and try to not go for extra steps for the methods. For the java files we were provided for the Assignment, I didn’t make any changes and leave everything as it is (except add on the JavaFX extension).
